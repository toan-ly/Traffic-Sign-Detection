# Traffic Sign Detection using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
## Overview
This project implements a traffic sign detection using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The system utilizes a combination of techniques including pyramid, sliding window, non-maximum suppression, and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for accurate detection and localization of traffic signs in images.

## Features
* __SVM Classification__: Utilizes SVM for robust classification of traffic sign images.
* __Pyramid and Sliding Window Approach__: Implements a pyramid and sliding window technique to detect objects at multiple scales within an image.
* __Non-Maximum Suppression__: Post-processing step to refine detections and eliminate redundant bounding boxes.
* __Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)__: Preprocessing technique to capture the shape and gradient information within localized regions of an image. This preprocessing step enhances the discriminative power of the SVM classifier.
